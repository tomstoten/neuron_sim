# Neuron Simulations with LIF and GLIF models

This is a class project for CSCI 4314 at CU Boulder.

We use the Leaky Integrate and Fire and the Generalized Leaky Integrate and Fire models to simulate an action potential in a neuron, and attempt to cascade action potentials from one neuron to the next.
